### Brief Comments about the Design:

I used material-ui as my component library. The easiest way to cusomtize their components is with JSS, which is written similarly to scss.

Adding flare could mean a lot of different things. Especially where developers are concerned, I feel like that includes adding a lot of emojis. 🎉🎉🎉🤣🤣🤣 I tried stick pretty directly to the design, and just added a few tiny things where specifically asked (animations, and rating).

Obviously it's not clear from the actual site, but I also included a small unit test for the 'Add to Cart' feature.
